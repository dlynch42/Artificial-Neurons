# Artificial-Neurons
This project looks to classify flowers into two categories, 'Setosa' and 'Versicolor', based off of variables 'Sepal Length' and 'Petal Length'. I programmed two simple artifical neurons and plotted their respective decision regions. It is broken up into two sections: Perceptron (in Perceptron.py) and Adaline (in Adaline.py). For the perceptron, I initialized the weights and then updated the weights using a unit step function after computing the output. I used the same process for Adaline, except updated the weights using a linear activation function. It is a project guided by Sebastian Raschka's Python Machine Learning.
